# Analytical Bayesian approach for the design of surveillance and control programs to assess pest-eradication success
R codes for models developed in "Analytical Bayesian approach for the design of surveillance and control programs to assess pest-eradication success" 
by B. Barnes, M. Parsa, F. Giannini and D. Ramsey.

In this paper we formulated an analytical Bayesian framework for a general biosecurity program with multiple components to assess pest-eradication success. 
Our model incorporates stochastic growth and detection processes, and several control mechanisms. 
Survey results and economic considerations are also taken into account to support a range of biosecurity management decisions.

# How to run the models
Two implementations of models are included for estimating various statistics developed in the paper. The first implementation uses numerical approximation
for calculating the derivatives, and the second one uses symbolic algebra. To run the models see exampleNumerical.R and exampleSymbolic.R.
